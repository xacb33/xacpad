### Challenges
Altough this wasn´t my first time using KiCad, this was the first time I really knew what I was doing. I spent too much time trying to figure out how to import libraries, but ended up doing it. It was my first time using Fusion360, and I think it´s going to be quite useful for me, as I always modeled everything for 3D printing in Tinkercad, but Fusion gives me the opportunity to model much more complex things (Altough that also means that it was diffcult to know what I was doing at first)
